# Task 3 – Text Generation Using Markov Chains

**Name:** Sushree Jagruti Priyadarshini 
**Internship Program:** Future Intern  
**Task Title:** Text Generation using Markov Chains  


## Objective:

The aim of this task was to understand how **Markov Chains** can be applied to text generation. The goal was to learn the working mechanism and implement a simple model using custom input.


## My Experience:

To complete this task, I implemented a basic text generation model using Markov Chains. I wrote the code in both `.ipynb` and `.py` formats, tested them successfully, and also recorded live demo videos showing the output generation process. This hands-on approach helped me understand how the next word prediction depends only on the current state, which is the core idea behind Markov Chains.


## Tools Used:

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Custom dataset (internship experience)  
- Online resources

## Input Text:

The input I used was a paragraph describing my internship journey with Future Intern — how I explored AI topics, worked with ChatGPT, overcame challenges using Google Colab, and gained exposure to real-world AI applications.


## Output (Generated Text Sample):

> STARTED MY INTERNSHIP WITH FUTURE I VE MADE AND DATA STRUCTURES THOUGH I DISCOVERED HOW AI INTERN AS AN AI COULD  
INTERNSHIP WITH TEXT GENERATION USING GPT 2 AND HOW AI COULD BE USED IN REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS AND EXCITED TO LEARN  
WITH FUTURE I EXPLORED TOPICS LIKE GOOGLE COLAB AND CURIOSITY I LEARNED TO LEARN EVEN MORE SKILLED CONFIDENT AND MARKOV CHAINS  
FUTURE INTERN FULL OF EXCITEMENT AND CURIOSITY I ALREADY FEEL MORE SKILLED CONFIDENT AND EXCITED TO THINK LOGICALLY LIKE A PROGRAMMER
