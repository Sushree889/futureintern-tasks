Internship Task Report: Text Generation Using Markov Chains

Name: Sushree Jagruti Priyadarshini 
Internship Program: Future Intern
Task Title: Text Generation Using Markov Chains

Objective

The aim of this task was to understand the concept of Markov Chains and apply it to generate text based on a given input dataset.

My Experience

Initially, I tried to implement the task using Google Colab. However, due to technical difficulties—mainly caused by working on a mobile device and my limited coding experience—I encountered persistent errors that prevented the code from running correctly. This was quite frustrating, but I chose not to give up and searched for alternative ways to complete the task.

Eventually, I discovered an online Markov Chain text generator tool at dcode.fr/markov-chain-text. This tool allowed me to input my custom text and generate new sentences based on the Markov Chain algorithm. The tool worked perfectly on my phone and helped me complete the task successfully.

Input Text Used

A paragraph describing my internship journey with Future Intern, detailing how I explored AI topics, used ChatGPT and Google Colab, struggled with technical tasks, and eventually learned more about real-world AI applications.

Generated Output (Markov Chain Result – 9 Sentences)

Conclusion

This task helped me grasp the fundamental working of Markov Chains and their application in text generation. Despite initial technical difficulties, finding an alternative tool enabled me to complete the task effectively. This experience enhanced my confidence and problem-solving abilities and motivated me to explore AI tools independently.
