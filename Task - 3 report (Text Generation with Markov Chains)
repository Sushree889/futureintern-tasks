Internship Task Report: Text Generation Using Markov Chains

Name: Sushree Jagruti Priyadarshini 
Internship Program: Future Intern
Task Title: Text Generation using Markov Chains


Objective:

The aim of this task was to understand the concept of Markov Chains and use it to generate text based on a given input.


My Experience:

At first, I attempted to perform this task using Google Colab, but I faced several technical issues. The environment showed continuous errors, and I couldn't get the code to work properly — possibly due to using a mobile device with no prior coding experience. This made me feel stuck, but I decided to find an alternate approach rather than giving up.

I found an online tool that generates Markov Chain text without coding: dcode.fr/markov-chain-text. It allowed me to paste my custom input text and generate a paragraph using the logic of Markov Chains. This approach worked smoothly on my phone, and I was finally able to complete the task.

Input Text Used:

A paragraph describing my internship journey with Future Intern — including how I explored AI topics, used ChatGPT and Google Colab, struggled with technical tasks, and eventually learned more about real-world AI applications.


Generated Output (Markov Chain Result – 9 Sentences):

> STARTED MY INTERNSHIP WITH FUTURE I VE MADE AND DATA STRUCTURES THOUGH I DISCOVERED HOW AI INTERN AS AN AI COULD

Conclusion:

This task taught me the fundamentals of how Markov Chains work and how they can be used for text generation. Though I initially faced technical challenges, I found a creative solution that allowed me to complete the task successfully. It boosted both my confidence and problem-solving skills, and I now feel more capable of learning new AI tools independently.
